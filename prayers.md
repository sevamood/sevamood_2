Sri Nrisimha Pranama

**namas te narasimhaya
prahladahlada-dayine
hiranyakasipor vakshahsila-
tanka-nakhalaye**

I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha who gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja and whose nails are like chisels
on the stonelike chest of the demon Hiranyakasipu.

**ito nrisimhah parato nrisimho
yato yato yami tato nrisimhah
bahir nrisimho hridaye nrisimho
nrisimham adim saranam prapadye**

Lord Nrisimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nrisimha is there. He is in the heart and is outside
as well. I surrender to Lord Nrisimha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.
Prayer to Lord Nrisimha
by Jayadeva Gosvami

**tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-sringam
dalita-hiranyakasipu-tanu-bhringam
kesava dhrita-narahari-rupa jaya jagadisa hare**

O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All glories
to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between oneâ€™s fingernails, so in the same way the body of the
wasplike demon Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful
lotus hands.
